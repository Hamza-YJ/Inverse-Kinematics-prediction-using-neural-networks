# Inverse-Kinematics-prediction-using-neural-networks
first Python script is to create a simple dataset for a 2 degree of freedom Cartesian robot arm using forward kinematics where the robot arm motor angles are the input
and it gives the orientation on a csv file as the output, Then used the created dataset as input to train a Keras Sequential model to be able to predict the robot motor angles
after the user give it the desired final orientation of the arm.
